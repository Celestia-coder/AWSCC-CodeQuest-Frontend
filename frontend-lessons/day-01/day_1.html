    This < body > element in HTML is where the core content of a web page 
    is placed. It is the user-visible part of the page and is responsible 
    for presenting information and interactions to website visitors.
    
    <p>This is the < p > paragraph tag</p>
        <p>You can write sentences and stories using < p >. 
            It's like writing a paragraph in a book. 
            The primary purpose of < p > is to separate 
            blocks of text into distinct paragraphs. 
            It automatically adds space before and after 
            the enclosed text, creating a visual 
            separation between paragraphs.
        </p>
    
    <div>
        <p>This is < div > element</p>
            <p>The div element, short for "division," is a 
                generic container used to group and structure 
                content within a web page. It doesn't carry 
                any inherent semantic meaning of its own, but 
                it's a fundamental building block for creating 
                layouts and organizing content. The primary 
                purpose of the < div > element is to apply 
                CSS styles or JavaScript functionality to 
                groups of HTML elements.
